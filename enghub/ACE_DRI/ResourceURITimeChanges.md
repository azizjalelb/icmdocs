# Finding Changes with a Specific Resource URI and Time Range

Project Coin is the only tool that can produce results for this scenario. Right now, Coin is an unfunded program that is not maintained and as a result, the user should proceed with caution when using this data. FCM plans to consume this data in Gallium. Once FCM has, Coin will eventually be retired. Release dates are still being established, please refer back to this page at a later date for new information. <!-- Coin should only be used for a specific set of scenarios. -->
