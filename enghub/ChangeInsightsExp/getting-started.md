### **2.2 Accessing the OneDeploy FCM Dashboard**

The **OneDeploy FCM Dashboard** is a tool for monitoring changes made across various services, regions, and entities. It provides comprehensive insights that are critical for understanding the impact of specific changes during an incident.

#### **How to Access**:

1. **Navigate to the Dashboard**:

   - The dashboard allows DRIs to:
     - View all changes made across regions, clusters, nodes, and services.
     - Zoom in on specific entities for detailed analysis or zoom out to observe broader patterns at the region level.
     - Monitor Service Deployment Progression (SDP) for any given payload to evaluate its deployment lifecycle.

* **Best Practices for Using the Dashboard** :
  * **Filter Wisely** : Start with broad filters and narrow down as needed.
  * **Focus on High-Risk Changes** : Prioritize changes with higher risk scores.
  * **Utilize Drill-Down Features** : Dive deep into specific payloads or nodes for detailed analysis.
