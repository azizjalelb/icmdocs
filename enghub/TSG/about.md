# Trouble Shooting Guides (TSGs)

A **troubleshooting** guide is a step by step document that enables the designated response individual (abbreviated as DRI; also commonly known as oncall) to diagnose, mitigate and determine impact of an incident. It is not a requirement for the DRI to have prior knowledge of the system they are investigating; rather, the TSG is written in such a way that any developer with enough tenure on the team can leverage it to mitigate incidents. The following pages contain troubleshooting guides for various FCM components. 

Please note the following:

- All tickets cut to FCM oncall rotations will have an assocaited TSG link embedded in the ticket.
  - If there is no TSG link embedded in the ticket, we will take up a task to add a TSG link or re-evaluate the ticket to see if it is require altogether. 
- In cases where the DRI is unable to successfully mitigate the ticket, escalation to the engineering manager is required, especially if availability is impacted.
- Please update the TSGs with new information. Our systems evolve all the time; so should our documentations around them.
- We are actively improving our TSG presence on engineering hub. We will continue to update docs and make additions.
