# Change Explorer User Guide

### Overview
Change Explorer is a part of FCM that is designed to be a flexible tool for asking the question, "What's Changed?" By specifying the time range, service, component and/or location, Change Explorer will give you an output of changes that fall within the criteria. The output displays (sometimes several) tables that are also filterable. Change Explorer also allows you to look up changes by entering a specific incident ID and will automatically populate the filters with the information found in the ICM incident. 

### Federated Data
If you are familiar with our previous FCM platform, Change Explorer is the newest version of FCM, visually and technically improved to easily search for changes that have occurred. Change Explorer contains the same data that was in FCM, but the experience has been upgraded to a faster, easier to use, and more informative product.
