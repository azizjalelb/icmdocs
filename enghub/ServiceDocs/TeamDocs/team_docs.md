# **Team Docs**

## What's in this section?

This section contains design documents related to the architecture and functionality of the services offered by FCM. 

## Are these the latest docs?

These documents are updated and published to engineering hub as the latest and greatest version, requiring PR approval to be posted. In some cases, we render the site as mark the doc as `WIP` so that certain attributes, like mermaid diagrams or docfx formatting, are visual to the reader.

>[!NOTE]
>Since many people are not used to the PR process of writing comments, we use [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) to export documents from *.md* to *.docfx* format for review sessions.
