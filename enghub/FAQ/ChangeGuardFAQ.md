#### CVP-Delegated Approval
The CVP may assign delegates to review changes. During the change advisories we expect there to be minimal changes moving through the fleet. All that is required is to locate the Service Group or Team Group in [Service Tree](http://aka.ms/servicetree) and update the Critical Change Approvers list (aliases only, DLs are not accepted).

Want to make changes to the approvers list? Ask your Chief of Staff to do the following:
1.	https://aka.ms/serviceTree > Organization Tab
2.	Select your Service Group on Left panel
3.	Select Metadata
4.	Review/Edit Critical Change Approvers //Any new changes will use this updated list of approvers.
